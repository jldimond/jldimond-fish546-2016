# Data

A starting set of 48 samples of _Porites_ spp. were prepared for ddRADseq and EpiRADseq according to methods described [here](http://onsnetwork.org/jdimond/2016/08/02/rad-sequencing-days-12/). A separate ddRAD and EpiRAD library was created for each sample, meaning that a total of 96 (48 ddRAD and 48 EpiRAD) samples were run on a 96 well plate. After barcodes were ligated, samples were combined into 12 tubes for indexing (via PCR). These 12 tubes were designated as libraries JD001_A through JDOO1_L before being sent to the Vincent J. Coates Genomic Sequencing Laboratory at UC Berkeley, where they were run on a single Illumina HiSeq 4000 lane in equimolar ratios (based on qPCR). The raw data consisting of 100 bp paired-end reads can be found [here](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/Porites_spp/).
